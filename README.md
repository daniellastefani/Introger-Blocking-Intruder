# Introger-Blocking-Intruder
Introger: Blocking Intruder is a device that allows you to lock your door from a distance and it's equipped with an LCD so you can notify people. 
Introger is basically an Intovert's Charger that helps you to tell other people when you want to be alone and lock them out, 
but this device can be used for a lot of things, like when you're already far away from home and you realize that you haven't locked your door.

For this project, the application used is Blynk which can be downloaded from Play Store and App Store. 
You just have to run the Blynk application and you can lock and unlock your door and input some text to be displayed on the LCD.
